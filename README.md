# Simon Joe, Memory Cat

#### A pattern-based memory test proctored by the mercurial Simon Joe

* He is very curious and never forgets. 
* He wants to love but is unsure of your worth.
* Try to repeat Simon's sequence, which increases by one each turn.
* After twenty successful turns, Simon Joe may let you into his heart.
* In harsh mode, he does not forgive.
* Each mistake resets the turn count with a fresh sequence.
* Be careful!
